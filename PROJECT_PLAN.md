# ClarityNOW Real Estate Portal - Project Plan

## Project Overview
ClarityNOW is a full-stack real estate management portal with dashboard analytics and property listings functionality. The application consists of a React frontend with TypeScript and Vite, and an Express.js backend with better-sqlite3 database.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Client)
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.0.4 
- **Routing**: React Router (to be installed)
- **UI**: Modern, responsive design based on provided mockups
- **State Management**: React state management for API data
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 with React Testing Library

### Backend (Server)  
- **Framework**: Express.js 5.1.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 12.2.0 with WAL mode
- **Development**: Nodemon for auto-restart
- **CORS**: Enabled for frontend communication

### Database Schema
Based on the mock API data, the database will track:
- **Portal Metrics**: Units, GCI, Volume (active/pending/closed states)
- **Financial Data**: Current profits, monthly profits, profit goals
- **Performance**: Ratings system
- **Time Series**: Monthly data tracking

### Routes Structure
- **Frontend Routes**:
  - `/` - Redirect to dashboard
  - `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with metrics and charts
  - `/listings` - Property listings management
  
- **API Routes**:
  - `GET /api/portal` - Get dashboard data
  - `PUT /api/portal` - Update portal metrics
  - `GET /api/listings` - Get property listings  
  - `POST /api/listings` - Create new listing
  - `PUT /api/listings/:id` - Update listing
  - `DELETE /api/listings/:id` - Delete listing

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Install React Router and configure routing
2. Set up Express server structure with TypeScript
3. Create database schema and connection setup
4. Establish API route structure

### Phase 2: Database & API Layer
1. Design and implement database tables
2. Create database access layer with prepared statements
3. Implement CRUD API endpoints
4. Add proper error handling and validation
5. Seed database with initial data

### Phase 3: Frontend Development  
1. Create shared components (Layout, Navigation)
2. Build Dashboard page with metrics visualization
3. Build Listings page with CRUD operations
4. Implement API integration with error handling
5. Add responsive design and modern UI

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Connect frontend to backend APIs
2. Test all routes and functionality
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Performance optimization and testing

## Technical Decisions

### Database Design
- Using better-sqlite3 for simplicity and performance
- WAL mode enabled for concurrent read/write performance
- Prepared statements for security and performance
- Foreign key constraints enabled

### API Design
- RESTful API structure
- JSON responses with consistent error handling
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- CORS configured for frontend communication

### Frontend Architecture
- Component-based architecture with React
- React Router for client-side routing
- Modern ES6+ features with TypeScript
- Responsive design principles

### Development Tools
- ESLint for code quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- Nodemon for development workflow
- Vite for fast development builds
